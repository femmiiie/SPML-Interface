# SPML-Interface
The intent of the Sponger Music Library Interface (SPMLI) is to:

Create a simple method of viewing and searching the TSLCA excel sheet of the same name.
Automatically and periodically update with the newest and most current additions to the spreadsheet.
Optionally force an update of the website to see the latest changes.
Seperate the updating and viewing processes to ensure security of data.
Allow specific searches and filters of data to find what is being looked for.
Serve as temp backup in case of excel failures.

This is achieved by:

A clean HTML/CSS interface to ensure seamless UI/UX
SQL table storage to efficiently find all entries
PHP to handle all data sanitization and server/client communication
JS to handle interactions between excel and the SQL database

This will be updated to be more specific as the project is completed.
